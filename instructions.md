# new setups don't forget to install flask with #pip install flask#
- Starts completely fresh for each classroom
- No old data carried over
- Clean database with only the current class's information
- Simple verification of required files


If starting fresh at school:
    Delete library.db before transferring
    Run database.py at school to create a new database
    Run import_data.py to import student and book data




python clean_data.py
python setup_check.py
python app.py
